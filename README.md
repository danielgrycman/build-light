Build Light
===========

Continuous Delivery is a pattern language used in software development to automate and improve the process of
software delivery. Techniques such as automated testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment allow
software to be developed to a high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test environments.

Continuous delivery treats the commonplace notion of a deployment pipeline: a set of validations through
which a piece of software must pass on its way to release. Code is compiled if necessary and then packaged by a
build server every time a change is committed to a source control repository, then tested by a number of different
techniques before it can be marked as releasable. It is important to understand that any code commit may be released to
customers at any point.

What is Build Light
-------------------

The article [Using a Raspberry PI to control an extreme feedback device](http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2013/07/using-a-raspberry-pi-to-control-an-extreme-feedback-devices/)
has inspired me to buy a traffic light in the [Cleware Shop](http://www.cleware-shop.de/).


### Installation ###

#### Installation Linux/Mac ####

```bash
berndzuther@Bernds-MacBook-Pro ~/Downloads$ tar xvf buildlight-0.1-DEV.zip
berndzuther@Bernds-MacBook-Pro ~/Downloads$ cd buildlight-0.1-DEV/bin
berndzuther@Bernds-MacBook-Pro ~/Downloads$ ./buildlight
```

#### Installation RaspberryPI ####

```bash
pi@raspberry ~$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 openjdk-7-jdk
pi@raspberry ~/Downloads$ tar xvf buildlight-0.1-DEV.zip
pi@raspberry ~/Downloads$ cd buildlight-0.1-DEV/bin
pi@raspberry ~/Downloads$ sudo ./buildlight
```

### Configuration ###

#### Jenkins ####

Create buildlight.properties in <buildlight directory>/bin - folder.

```bash
➜  bin  cat buildlight.properties
build.server=Jenkins
jenkins.server.url=http://localhost:8080/build-server
jenkins.build.name=Build-Light-Test-Build
buildlight.driver.factorybean=com.github.zutherb.buildlight.application.driver.ClewareDriverFactoryBean
```

#### Bamboo ####

Create buildlight.properties in <buildlight directory>/bin - folder.

```bash
➜  bin  cat buildlight.properties
build.server=Bamboo
bamboo.server.url=http://localhost:8080/build-server
bamboo.build.key=BUILDLIGHT_JOB
bamboo.username=zutherb
bamboo.password=t0ps3cr3t
buildlight.driver.factorybean=com.github.zutherb.buildlight.application.driver.BlinkStickDriverFactoryBean
```

Arduino Traffic Java Driver
---------------------------

Step 1: Shut off all Serial Action going on with the Pi.

You have to edit two places.  The first ‘/boot/cmdline.txt’ - delete

```bash
console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200
```

Then bounce over to /etc/inittab and we have to comment out the last line by adding the # to the beginning.

```bash
#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
```

Step 2: Install Oracle Java und RXTX JNI Library.

```bash
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk librxtx-java
```

Step 3: Create buildlight.properties in <buildlight-pi directory>/bin - folder.

```bash
➜  bin  cat buildlight.properties
build.server=Jenkins
jenkins.server.url=http://localhost:8080/build-server
jenkins.build.name=Build-Light-Test-Build
buildlight.driver.factorybean=com.github.zutherb.buildlight.application.driver.ArduinoDriverFactoryBean
#buildlight.arduino.port=/dev/ttyACM0 [Default]
#buildlight.arduino.switch.on.level=HIGH [Default - Choose LOW ,e.g. when relays switch on low pegal]

```

public class TrafficLightFactoryTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficLight light = TrafficLightFactory.createNewInstance();
        light.switchOn(Led.RED);
        light.switchOffAllLeds();
        light.close();
    }
}
```
